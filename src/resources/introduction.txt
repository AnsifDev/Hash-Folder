    Thanks for choosing me... The purpose of my build is to provide you a syncing folder powered by github.

Aim: You can create a perfectly syncable folder which can be used in your labs, for keeping your program files, makes you accessible anywhere you want. All you want is:

1. Login to github using this app.
2. Create an SSH Key via this app.
3. Clone or create the repositories you want.
3. Log out from this app and web browser.

All you need is the SSH-Key Password, you can continue syncing the repositories you just downloaded even if you logged out.
